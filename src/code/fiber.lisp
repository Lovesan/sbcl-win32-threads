;;;; Support for userspace-scheduled thread-like fibers in the target machine.

;;;; Current implementation, restricted to win32, uses system
;;;; fibers. For unix-like systems with native pthreads something
;;;; similar could be done with setjmp/longjmp.
;;;;
;;;; Our C-level wrapper for WinNT system fibers adds a concept of
;;;; ownership: though system fibers as such aren't "owned" by
;;;; threads, pthreads_win32-managed fibers are. Once created, fibers
;;;; can be transferred to other threads.
;;;;
;;;; This implementation is not yet ready to be used in applications
;;;; as a userspace scheduling tool (coroutines, one-shot
;;;; continuations); it will work in principle, but there are too many
;;;; uncovered pits to be checked, amended or documented in the
;;;; future. Its main use, especially for win32, is accepting
;;;; callbacks in foreign threads, running their code in the same
;;;; thread where they were received.
;;;;
;;;; SBCL's problem with foreign thread callbacks is caused by the
;;;; following facts:
;;;;
;;;; * Each SBCL thread is set up (cleaned up) in a complicated
;;;;   manner, around the extent where it's visible to Lisp and its
;;;;   GC, and where it may be used for Lisp code evaluation.
;;;;
;;;; * Foreign thread callbacks are invoked on foreign stack. Even if
;;;;   it's detected by examining TLS storage, SBCL can't wrap its
;;;;   thread initialization code around this stack.
;;;;
;;;; * GC has to examine other threads' contexts. It relies on many
;;;;   specific features of SBCL-created threads, and expects control
;;;;   stack to be continuous (and, on some platforms, page-aligned).
;;;;
;;;; * SBCL expects only Lisp threads to create new Lisp
;;;;   threads. Special support for initial thread context setup is
;;;;   provided, only for (initially)non-Lisp application main thread.
;;;;
;;;; There are approximately three classes of solutions. We could:
;;;;
;;;; 1. Create Lisp thread context each time when a callback is
;;;; invoked by foreign thread. Problem1.1: foreign stack may be too
;;;; small, and we have no control over it. Problem1.2: doing thread
;;;; context setup multiple times for the same foreign thread is
;;;; wasteful.
;;;;
;;;; 2. Create a thread running a foreign callback server. When
;;;; foreign callback is detected, a message is sent to server;
;;;; foreign thread waits for an answer and then returns. Multiple
;;;; server threads may be used to allow several simultaneous
;;;; callbacks. Problem2.1. Callouts-in-callback don't run on the same
;;;; thread where callback is invoked. Foreign libraries with
;;;; thread-specific state might not expect it. Problem2.2. Destroying
;;;; unused thread contexts is complicated; naive methods can be
;;;; ineffective and wasteful in more than one way.
;;;;
;;;; 3. Create a thread context for foreign threads from Lisp
;;;; (possibly on demand, e.g. with client-server approach), then run
;;;; foreign calls in their native foreign threads, but on this Lisp
;;;; stack context. Solves problems 1.1, 1.2, 2.1; if we create a
;;;; context once for each unknown foreign thread, problem 2.2 is
;;;; solvable if we are able to detect when foreign thread exists
;;;; (fortunately the latter is trivial for win32). Fibers are useful
;;;; here: they _are_ little more than bare stack contexts without
;;;; threads behind them. System win32 fibers are easier to use than
;;;; setjmp/longjmp, because the system creates and manages fiber
;;;; stack address space itself.
;;;;
;;;; When a 3rd kind of solution is used, and the context is created
;;;; once per each foreign thread, it means, additionally, that
;;;; Lisp-level thread introspection provides valid results for
;;;; foreign threads too.
