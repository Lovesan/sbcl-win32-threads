;;; Fortunately, dynamic linking is already working at this stage. On
;;; win32, however, dynamic foreign symbols for link-time dependencies
;;; are not available before explicit LoadLibrary on them. As far as I
;;; know, dlopen() on Unix resolves such symbols with
;;; *runtime-dlhandle*, so it's not a problem to use them in warm-only
